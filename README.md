# COVIDWATCH-NPA
# This repository contains the code required to build an RShiny website that loads in COVID-19 data from various sources.
# It must be noted that some country's open repositories of COVID-19 data are no longer being updated (as of 2024).
# However, all 9 countries involved in this project have complete data from Feb 2020 to May 2023.
